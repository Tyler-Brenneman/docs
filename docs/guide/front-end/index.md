In order to have Vite generate bundles correctly you will need to have your front end structutre setup in a particular way.

## Remove webpack

Before installing Vite and getting your configuration setup it is recommended to remove all traces of webpack from your front end project.

## Identify dependencies

These will be completely different for each project so I would recommend you have a look through the [community maintained templates](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#templates) for Vite that will help you get started.

## Migration considerations

No two projects will be the same and instructions can only do so much to inform how to migrate to Vite. Many factors will need to be taken into consideration as project structures vary widely depending on whether you are using the AEM Maven Archetype or a custom structure.

Regardless, it is important to have a clear understanding of the structure needed to achieve successful workflows.
