In order to have Vite generate bundles correctly you will need to have your front end structutre setup in a particular way.

## Remove webpack

Before installing Vite and getting your configuration setup it is recommended to remove all traces of webpack from your front end project.

## Identify dependencies

These will be completely different for each project so I would recommend you have a look through the [community maintained templates](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#templates) for Vite that will help you get started.
